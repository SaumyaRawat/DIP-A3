KTH Multiview Football Dataset
Version: 1.0

This dataset is consisted of 771 images of football players, which
includes images taken from 3 views at 257 time instances. 180 of the 
images can be used for training and the rest (591) for testing.

Each image comes with 14 annotated body joints which are compatible 
with the popular "Image Parsing Dataset". The annotations are provided
in a MATLAB .mat file, and stored in a single 3D matrix (ptsAll). 

We have further provided another set of annotations (ptsAll3D), which
is very similar to the former one, with the difference that left/right
limb's order are consistent across all the examples. This is useful for 
3D reconstruction purposes.
